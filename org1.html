                        <p>Our customer surveys and interviews have revealed a need for thought leadership. To this end we are developing new products through research and co-creation, and applying previously developed products in other sectors.

                    <div class="about-para">
                        <p>There is a wide range of internationalisation activities in the various education sectors. We offer distinctive services tailored to the developments under way in each sector:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>primary education: the youngest pupils also stand to benefit greatly from international experience. We are expanding our advisory and informational role to reach more schools and, more importantly, more pupils.</p></li>
                            <li><p>secondary education: it is important for the sector to develop a cohesive internationalisation policy. We aid schools in the process of internationalisation and the professional development of their teachers.</p></li>
                            <li><p>vocational education and training (VET): we assist VET institutions in the professionalisation of the education they provide and in making internationalisation an embedded component of education. We are doing so by offering new services aimed at increasing the mobility of students and teachers.</p></li>
                            <li><p>teacher-training programmes: we intend to reinforce the foundations. Internationalisation in education requires qualified teachers. Every student who completes a teacher-training programme should possess the knowledge and skills necessary to incorporate internationalisation into their lessons. That is our ideal.</p></li>
                            <li><p>higher education: We assist institutions in selecting the form of internationalisation that best fits their needs. Our goal is to ensure that by 2020 all Dutch higher education institutions have the knowledge required to choose appropriate options. We will also be aiding them in the hunt for talent.</p></li>
