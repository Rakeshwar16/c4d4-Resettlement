                   </div>

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>This action research involved participatory approach. Application designed with functionalities of above sorted need for the community.

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>Following the detailed need analysis, app was developed accordingly that would meet their requirements as quoted by each of them in the pre-test focus group discussion.

                   </div>

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>The post-test questionnaire helps analyse the impact and awareness created on the knowledge of participants. The questionnaire had app usability- based questions like ‘How easy was the application to use?’ and also open-ended questions on how the application maybe improved.</p>

                       <h1>OUTCOME OF THE STUDY :</h1>
                   </div>

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>The ICT tool that was used in this case to empower women was a mobile application which was developed based on the need analysis report collected from the women of Perumbakkam. The need analysis lamented various issues like transportation facility, lack of jobs, hospital facilities, safety threats and network connectivity.</p>
                   </div>

                   <div class="about-para">
                    <p>For almost more than half of the participants this was their first time in using a mobile phone because in majority households the mobile phones are owned wither by men or grand children. And for those women owning a mobile phone , this app turned out to be the first one they use.</p>
                   </div>

                   <div class="about-para">
                    <p>Despite the network issue and no access to mobile phones being an hindrance to one set of women , others managed to check the app regularly and if at all attempted to explore the technology to seek information. Initial acceptance by two-third of people shows that need is properly identified and application is easy to use which changed altitude of users. Application acceptance by even elder people of community proves age is not a affecting external factor and any
                        properly identified pre-study can make people accept technology.</p>
