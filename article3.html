                  <div class="about-para">
                    <p>Perumbakkam, one of the largest resettlement sites that was constructed to accommodate people who were evicted from alongside river bodies and adjacent slums. Since, location of the site was pretty far away from the Chennai city centre, they faced crisis when it came to sustaining their previous jobs. Given that the place was new to them they also had difficulty in searching for new jobs as they weren’t familiar about the locality. There came a livelihood downfall, in a way a shock that had an impact on their economic stability.</p>
                   </div>

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>Adding to the disadvantages that already prevailed among the urban poor, the relocation added burden to the women of each household with regard to livelihood management as they couldn’t travel all the way to the places where they used to work earlier. Initiatives from Government and other NGOs has delivered various freebies to the people as a part of compensation , one among which is the tailoring machines.</p>
                   </div>

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>Government as a part of empowering the community, has offered various special trainings like stitching / tailoring, beauticians, jewellery making for the women from Perumbakkam. Equipped with such skill set was an advantage but unavailability of ideas, funds and support to capitalize their skills was a disadvantage. In order to lend them the needed support and motivate them to utilize their skill and extend their potential capabilities we organised a focus group activity involving 10 women as an initial experiment to test the positive deviance approach.</p>

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>We located women from Perumbakkam who had tailoring skills and owned a mobile phone was spotted / located and gathered at a common place. Pre-survey was conducted for them where their basic details like age, monthly income, the skills they know was collected along with their willingness to start a business from home, how many hours will they be able to denote towards the business and other data.</p>

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>After the data collection, a series of videos that featured inspiring stories from around the country that had single women, disabled and women groups excelling on their own with the help of community start-ups despite the disadvantages and struggles. This activity was carried out in order to stimulate the interest among the women in taking
                        up entrepreneurial activities and motivate their confidence level which was considered to be low for obvious reasons.</p>
                   </div>

                   <div class="about-para">
                       <p>Post the video screenings, a focus group study was conducted where the women shared their impression, feedbacks and suggestions on how to set up and build the business from their home. They also shared their needs that will enhance their skills and production.</p>
