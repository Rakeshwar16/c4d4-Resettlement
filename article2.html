                       <p>The first activity as a part of ice breaker session was “housing vision” where the women were asked to draw their dream houses, how they visualise their own houses. This activity was done with the help of master’s students. The outcome of the drawings done by the women reflected their desire to have a lawn, gardens, schools, hospital around their dream houses. This envisaged the need for involving the community people while designing and planning the resettlement sites for the actual construction of the houses turn out to be extremely contradictory to the expectation of the people.</p>
